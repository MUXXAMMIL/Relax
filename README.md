# Microwave-Integrated-Retrieval-System-MIRS
Center for Satellite Applications and Research Microwave Integrated Retrieval System (MiRS) Software (Version 11.9)

This repository contains the MiRS software package. There are several files available:
* MiRS User Manual
* MiRS Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document
* The official delivery memo describing the satellites that MiRS may process, the official products which are generated, as well as changes made relative to the previous release of MiRS.
* The main package: a compressed tar file containing all the necessary source codes, scripts, configuration and ancillary data files.

Once the tar file is uncompressed and unpacked, the README file under <installation_directory>/src/README can be referred to for more information on how to build and run MiRS.

Further questions may be addressed to quanhua.liu@noaa.gov or christopher.grassotti@noaa.gov
